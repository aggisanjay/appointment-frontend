# Appointment Booking System (Frontend)

This is the frontend for the Advanced Babysteps Appointment Booking System, developed using React. The application enables users to select doctors, view available appointment slots, book appointments, and manage upcoming appointments.

## Features

### 1. Doctor Selection
- Users can view a list of doctors and select one to book an appointment with.

### 2. Calendar/Slot View
- After selecting a doctor, users can view the upcoming 7 days on a calendar or date picker.
- Available time slots for the selected date are fetched from the backend.

### 3. Appointment Booking
- Users can click on an available slot to open a booking form.
- The booking form captures additional details such as:
  - Patient name
  - Appointment type
  - Notes
- Upon submission, the app sends a request to the backend to book the appointment.

### 4. Appointment Management
- Users can view their upcoming appointments.
- Users can edit or cancel their appointments as needed.

## State Management & API Integration

- State management is implemented using React state (or Redux if needed) to manage:
  - List of doctors
  - Available slots
  - User appointments
- API calls are made to the backend to fetch data, including:
  - List of doctors
  - Available time slots
  - Appointment booking, editing, and cancellation
- Loading states and error handling are implemented when interacting with the API.

## UI/UX Considerations

- The design is minimal and intuitive for easy navigation.
- Material-UI or Bootstrap can be used for UI components and faster development.
